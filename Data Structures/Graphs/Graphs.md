# 1. Graph Foundations

## Concepts

* Graph terminology

  * Vertex (Node)
  * Edge
  * Degree
* Types of graphs

  * Directed vs Undirected
  * Weighted vs Unweighted
  * Cyclic vs Acyclic
  * Connected vs Disconnected

## Representations

### Adjacency List (Preferred)

* Space efficient

### Adjacency Matrix

* Useful for dense graphs

## Practice

* Build graph from edge list
* Print adjacency list
* Count connected components

---

# 2. Graph Traversal (Core Topic)

## 2.1 Depth First Search (DFS)

### Implementations

* Recursive DFS
* Iterative DFS (stack)

### Applications

* Connected components
* Path existence

# 6. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Kruskal’s Algorithm

* Sort edges by weight
* Use Union-Find

## Prim’s Algorithm

* Similar to Dijkstra
* Priority queue

---

# 7. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

## Operations

* find()
* union()

## Optimizations

* Path compression
* Union by rank/size

## Applications
