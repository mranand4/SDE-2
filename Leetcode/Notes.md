# Backtracking

1. [VVIP] Common generic template which applies to many problems - https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/solutions/27281/a-general-approach-to-backtracking-quest-0ea5/

2. Reference link for stack and queue based solutions - https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/solutions/68272/python-solutions-dfsstack-bfsqueue-dfs-r-k9fg/

3. Handling duplicate permutations type of questions -  https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/solutions/18594/really-easy-java-solution-much-easier-th-lpev/

4. Nikhil Lohia subset 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyyzpNlMDU , uses list contains.

5. In Java, List.contains() uses the .equals() method to compare elements.

- For a List<List<Integer>>:
- List.equals() compares element-by-element
- If another list has same size and hasthe same values in the same order, then it is considered equal.

6. Subset, combinations are "look forward solution" or "forward seeking solution", permutation is a "look forward and backwards solution". In look forward sols, prev. elements are automatically ignored.
